# MobileCoderMCP Rules
# This file defines strict rules that the AI must follow for every request.

# Type Safety
Never use 'any' type in TypeScript. Always define proper interfaces or types.

# Styling
Must use TailwindCSS classes for styling. Do not use inline styles or separate CSS files unless absolutely necessary.

# Code Quality
- Prefer functional components over class components.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep components small and focused.
